# ChatChat
A opensource chat Java software.\
It's a project I made during the first semester of my first year of engineering school at the INSA Strasbourg.
We were supposed to do it in groups, but because my colleagues didn't know how to code a user interface I had to do it myself.

Please feel free to have a look at the presentation, to have an overview of what the project looks like.
The project uses Swing for the graphical user interface.
